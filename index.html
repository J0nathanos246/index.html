    <h3><u>Abstract:</u></h3>
    <p> Linacs and cyclotrons are the two particle accelerators researched for this article. 
      <br>Linacs accelerate particles in a straight line and uses oppositely charged drift tubes 
      <br>connected to a pulse waveform to accelerate particles. Cyclotrons use a magnet split 
      <br>into two dees oppositely charged to deflect the charged particles to follow a circular 
      <br>path. With both of these examples electric and magnetic fields are in use, the particles 
      <br>are only accelerated when crossing the gap between dees or drift tubes. Synchrotron 
      <br>radian is used to find the particles relativistic momentum and charge, it also tells us 
      <br>that any charged particle moving through a charged electric or magnetic field would 
      <br>experience a force. The Lorentz’s factor is used for these particles when moving at 
      <br>relativistic speeds. Theres also limitations that we face when dealing with particle 
      <br>accelerators, these are the size and strength of magnets required to keep the high 
      <br>energy beams on course and the size of accelerators used.</p>

    <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
    <p>Today in the world there are more than 35000 particle accelerators, all used in a wide varity 
      <br>of different applications in physics, chemistry, medicine and structure analysis. The largest 
      <br>particle accelerator (Large Hadron Collider) can be found in Geneva Switzerland, this can 
      <br>create beams of energy of 7 Tev. </p>

    <h3><u>Types of particle accelerators:</u></h3>
    <p>Linear particle accelerators (linac) use accelerator modules aslo known as drift tubes, that are 
      <br>cylindrical hollow electrodes, coupled behind each other connected to a pulsed waveform 
      <br>that generates an accelerating gap between the two oppositely charged electrodes. For 
      <br>positively charged particles, these oppositely charged particles repel the particle from 
      <br>positive electrode and attracts them towards the negative electrode over the gap between 
      <br>them. The gap between modules increases when particles have low energy this is due to the 
      <br>particles accelerating at a greater magnitude when at low speeds, but when particles have 
      <br>high energy the distance of the acceleration gap doesn’t change size. </p>
