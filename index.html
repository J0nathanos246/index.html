    <h2><u>Abstract:</u></h2>
    <p> Linacs and cyclotrons are the two particle accelerators researched for this article. <br>Linacs accelerate particles in a straight line and uses oppositely charged drift tubes <br>connected to a pulse waveform to accelerate particles. Cyclotrons use a magnet split <br>into two dees oppositely charged to deflect the charged particles to follow a circular <br>path. With both of these examples electric and magnetic fields are in use, the particles <br>are only accelerated when crossing the gap between dees or drift tubes. Synchrotron <br>radian is used to find the particles relativistic momentum and charge, it also tells us <br>that any charged particle moving through a charged electric or magnetic field would <br>experience a force. The Lorentzâ€™s factor is used for these particles when moving at <br>relativistic speeds. Theres also limitations that we face when dealing with particle <br>accelerators, these are the size and strength of magnets required to keep the high <br>energy beams on course and the size of accelerators used.</p>
